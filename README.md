I have created an email system which will classify whether the email belongs to 1. Student inquiry 2. Coorporate inquiry 3. Academic colaboration.
The classification is done based on a dataset.

The project is built around fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model for the classification task using a custom synthetic dataset of email content.
